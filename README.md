# Learning-to-Recognize-a-Broken-Heart

## Problem Description
An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Arrhythmia has two 
types which are ventricular fibrillation(VF) and atrial fibrillation(AF). The project mainly 
focuses on the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation(AF).

This project aims to leverage an ECG dataset for phase-space reconstruction, exploring optimal methodologies in the process. Furthermore, it will investigate the potential role of cutting-edge, fully-automated software—developed with the help of convolutional neural networks, a subset of machine learning—in assisting arrhythmia diagnosis. The focus will be on the diagnostic potential drawn from the Reconstructed Phase Space (RPS) of ECG readings.
